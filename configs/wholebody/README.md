# 2D Human Whole-Body Pose Estimation (Top-down)

2D human whole-body pose estimation aims to localize dense landmarks on the entire human body including face, hands, body, and feet.
Top-down methods divide the task into two stages: human detection and whole-body pose estimation.
They perform human detection first, followed by single-person whole-body pose estimation given human bounding boxes.
